# netflixAndChill
Just a silly chrome extension to make popcorn when you start a binge sesh.  
Will bring it right to you. And clean up. Eventually.

## Flow: 
- You watch Netflix, Chrome sends a [server](https://github.com/austince/pop) running on a local raspi a requests to make popcorn.
- The raspi, connected via GPIO controlled relay, starts up a popcorn maker
- The popcorn maker pops directly into a receptical placed upon a [Roomba](http://giphy.com/gifs/cat-roomba-cqG5aFdTkk5ig)
- An Arduino, connected to the raspi via serial port, listens for the end of kernel popping as let's the popper know to STOP
- When popping is timed-out, or no more kernels are popping, the server contacts an Android phone connected via serial ports to the Roomba
- The Android controls the motors of the Roomba, guiding the popcorn to you, cleaning up what it (and you) spill along the way.

In summary: Netflix -> Chrome -> Raspi -> Popcorn Popper, Arduino -> Raspi -> Android -> Roomba -> You

_Simple, no?_
